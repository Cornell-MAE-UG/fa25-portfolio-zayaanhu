Problem Statement: Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.


In 2025, I was tasked with building an actuator that could support a load. What I did in order to come up with this design was think about how I had solved some problems in the past. I also considered the statics problems that I had done in the past and how the placement of supports. I also wanted to place this somewhere where I would not have to worry about deformation when the load is applied.

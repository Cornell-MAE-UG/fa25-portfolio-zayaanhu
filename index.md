## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a current sophomore studying biomedical engineering in the college of engineering here at Cornell University. I am deeply interested in biomechanics, medicine, finance, and innovation. Outside of academics, I am a swimmer and enjoy trying new foods, exploring new places, spending time with friends, and driving.
